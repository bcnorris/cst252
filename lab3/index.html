	<h1>Brendan Norris (he/him)</h1>

	<p>The task we are completing is a War style card game. There are 2 players with equal amount of cards. The cards are shuffled and split evenly amongst the players. Then each player draws 1 card from their deck. The player with the higher card wins the battle. Then the process is repeated until there are no more cards left. If there is a tie, the players reveal their next card until someone wins. The player with the most battles won at the end is the winner of the War. </p>

	<ul>
		<li>Actions are to play card, battle card, and take prize, and then repeat</li>
		<li>Only thing to remember is the rules. Higher value card wins the battle and player with more cards at the end wins</li>
		<li>The repeating action is playing a card from your pile</li>
		<li>The decisions needed to be made during war is who wins each battle and who has the most cards at the end</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Pseudocoding</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Each player reveals the card at the top of the deck (What is done over and over)</li>
			<li>Cards are compared to see who wins the battle (taking an action)</li>
			<li>Make a note of who won the battle (What is being remembered)</li>
			<li>Whoever wins the battle gets a point added to their total(make a decision)</li>
		</ul>
