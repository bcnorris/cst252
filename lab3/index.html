	<p>The task we are completing is a War style card game. There are 2 players with equal amount of cards. The cards are shuffled and split evenly amongst the players. Then each player draws one card from their deck. The player with the higher card wins the battle. Then the process is repeated until there are no more cards left. If there is a tie, the players reveal their next card until someone wins. The player with the most battles won at the end is the winner of the War. </p>

	<ul>
		<li>Actions are to play card, battle card, and take prize, and then repeat</li>
		<li>Only thing to remember is the rules. Higher value card wins the battle and player with more cards at the end wins</li>
		<li>The repeating action is playing a card from your pile</li>
		<li>The decisions needed to be made during war is who wins each battle and who has the most cards at the end</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="pseudo"> <em>Pseudocoding</em></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Each player reveals the card at the top of the deck <strong>(What is done over and over)</strong></li>
			<li>Cards are compared to see who wins the battle <strong> (Taking an action)</strong></li>
			<li>Make a note of who won the battle <strong>  (What is being remembered)</strong></li>
			<li>Whoever wins the battle gets a point added to their total<strong>   (Make a decision)</strong></li>
		</ul>
