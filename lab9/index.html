    <h1 id="title">Lab 9 Javascript Events and Forms</h1>
    <button id="btn">Click me!</button>
    <div id="hover">
        <h2>Hover over me!</h2>
    </div>
    

    <h1>Challenges</h1>
        <p>The challenge I had was making sure the javascript code was in the right place. It had to be wrapped inside of a function --> document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {}); in order to work properly.</p>
    <h1>Problems</h1>
        <p>I didn't run into too many problems. The only issue I had was when I created the second Event, the object I used was from my first Event because I used it as a reference. I realized the mistake and fixed it by changing button to hoverEvent. </p>
    <h1>Results</h1>
        Both of my events are working properly. I'd be interested in seeing what other events are possible and which elements can be changed.
