        <h1>Lab 7 - Brendan Norris</h1>  
          <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>The biggest challenge was making sure everything made it into the console when the page loads. It was also difficult making the functions appear in the HTML. Andrew assisted me with that and I was able to make it appear. </p>
          <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>I think I figured out each task and was able to work through the lab without any major problems or remaining questions.</p>
          <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>My array and all my functions appeared in the console and the HTML.</p>
    <p class="results">
      <script type="text/javascript">
        document.write("This is the original array: " + array + " ");
        document.write("<br>" + "<br>");
        document.write("This function will multiply the array by 4, these are the results below:");
        document.write("<br>" + "<br>");
        document.write(results);
        document.write("<br>" + "<br>");
          document.write("This function will subtract 1 from each number in the array, these are the results below:");
          document.write("<br>" + "<br>");
          document.write(newFunction);
        </script>
